# UmbracoHomework
This repository contains my solution for the homework assignment. 

## Getting Started

Once the project is cloned you can open the 'AcmeCorporation.sln' found in the 'AcmeCorporation' project folder.

Once you have the solution up and running do the following:

- Migrate the database by writing `Add-Migration InitialCreate` in the Package Manager Console. This will result in two tabels, "Submission" and "SerialNumber". These are both empty.
- Update the database by writing `Update-Database` in PMC.
- Build the solution by pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`B`
- To run the application, simply press `Ctrl`+`F5` (to run without debugging).
- Once the application is running, the "Program.cs" will check if there are currently anything in the SerialNumber table, if not, it will generate 100 Guids. 
- Go to "SQL Server Object Explorer" in Visual Studio, by pressing `Ctrl`+`Â½`,`Ctrl`+`S` or "View" -> "SQL Server Object Explorer".
- Open "SQL Server" -> "Database" -> "AcmeCorporation.Data" -> "Tables".
- Right click on "dbo.SerialNumber" and press "View Data".
- If the table is empty, is might need to be refreshed.
- Use one of the generated Guids to enter the draw.
